  caveats <<~EOS
    Halo is a personal open-source build and is not notarized by Apple.
    If macOS blocks the first launch, clear the quarantine flag:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Halo.app
    or approve it under System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.

    On first launch, grant Accessibility access to enable the
    volume/brightness HUD replacement.
